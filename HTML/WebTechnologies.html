        <p>Client-Server Architecture

Definition:
Client-server is a network architecture where clients (users or devices) request services or resources, and servers provide those services or resources.

Key Components:

Client:

Requests data or services.

Typically a web browser, mobile app, or software.

Does not share its resources but initiates communication.

Server:

Responds to client requests.

Provides services such as web pages, files, databases, or applications.

Can handle multiple client requests simultaneously.

How It Works:

Client sends a request to the server (e.g., a user opens a website).

Server processes the request.

Server sends back the appropriate response (e.g., HTML page).

Client receives and displays the data.

Examples:

Web: Browser (client) ‚Üî Web server

Email: Email app (client) ‚Üî Mail server

Database: Application (client) ‚Üî Database server

Advantages:

Centralized control and data storage.

Easier maintenance and security.

Scalable with proper configuration.

Disadvantages:

Server downtime can impact all clients.

Can become expensive with high traffic.

Performance depends on server capacity.</p>

üñ•Ô∏è 2. Backend (Server-Side)

Definition: Handles business logic, database interactions, and client requests.

Key Technologies:

Languages: Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby

Frameworks: Express.js, Django, Spring, Laravel

Ensure data consistency and security

‚òÅÔ∏è 4. Web Server

Definition: A server that handles HTTP requests and serves the frontend content.

Examples:

Apache

Nginx

Node.js (can act as a web server too)

Responsibilities:

Serve static files (HTML, CSS, JS)

Forward API calls to backend services

Handle security (HTTPS, SSL)

üåê 5. Application Server

Definition: Hosts the backend application logic and communicates with the web server and database.

Responsibilities:

        <h2 id="http-request">HTTP Request</h2>
        <img src="./Assests/HTTP Request.png" alt="HTTP Request">
        <p>üîç HTTP Request
What is it?

An HTTP Request is a message sent by a client (usually a web browser) to a server to ask for data or perform an action on a web resource.

Key Parts of an HTTP Request:

Request Line

Method (or Verb) ‚Äî What action the client wants (e.g., GET, POST)

URL (Uniform Resource Locator) ‚Äî The resource the client wants

HTTP Version ‚Äî The version of HTTP being used (e.g., HTTP/1.1)

        <img src="./Assests/Dynamic Pages.png" alt="Dynamic Pages">
        <p>üåê Dynamic Web Pages
What Are Dynamic Web Pages?

Dynamic web pages are web pages that change content dynamically, based on user interaction, data, or other real-time factors, rather than showing the same fixed content every time.

Unlike static web pages, which show the same HTML content every time, dynamic pages can display different information for different users or update automatically.

How Dynamic Web Pages Work

Client requests a page

Server processes logic (using programming languages like PHP, Python, Node.js)

Server generates HTML content on the fly based on input, database data, or other factors

Server sends the customized HTML back to the client

Client browser renders the page

Technologies Behind Dynamic Web Pages

Server-side languages: PHP, Python (Django/Flask), Ruby (Rails), Java (Spring), Node.js

Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB to store and retrieve data

Client-side scripting: JavaScript for interactive changes without page reload (AJAX, React, Vue)

Templating engines: Tools that help generate HTML dynamically (e.g., EJS, Jinja2)</p>

What is an Application Server?

An Application Server is a software framework that provides an environment to run and manage business logic and application services for web applications. It acts as a middle layer between the web server (which handles HTTP requests) and the database.

Key Functions of an Application Server:

Execute business logic: Runs the core code that powers the app‚Äôs features (e.g., processing orders, calculations, validations).

Manage application resources: Handles tasks like transaction management, connection pooling, and security.

Handle client requests: Receives requests from web servers or clients, processes them, and returns results.

Middleware services: Supports messaging, authentication, and API integration.

Session management: Tracks user sessions across multiple requests.</p>

        <p>üîí Web Security
What is Web Security?

Web Security involves protecting websites, web applications, and online services from cyber threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, attacks, and other vulnerabilities.

Common Web Security Threats:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Attackers inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users.

SQL Injection: Malicious SQL commands are inserted into input fields to manipulate databases.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts.

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Intercepting and altering communication between client and server.

Denial of Service (DoS): Overloading a server to make a service unavailable.

Brute Force Attacks: Trying multiple passwords or keys to gain unauthorized access.</p>
